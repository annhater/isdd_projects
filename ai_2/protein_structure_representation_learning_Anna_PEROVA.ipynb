        "#### Questions\n",
        "1. What does the first layer of Conv3D do?\n",
        "\n",
        "First Conv3D layer that uses a kernel_size = (1,1,1) is a linear activation. Kernel size of 1 * 1 * 1 performs a pointwise convolution i.e. it looks at the channels within a voxel and projects them into a new 20-dimentional space. We use it for feature extraction, this allows for a model to first look at the linear structure before scanning for spacial features.\n",
        "2. What activation functions are used in this architecture?\n",
        "  * Linear: Used in the first convolutional layer (identity function).\n",
        "  * ELU: Used in the second and third convolutional layers, as well as the first two Dense layers.\n",
        "  * Softmax: Used in the final output layer to produce a **probability distribution** across the 20 possible amino acid classes.\n",
        "3. What is the difference between ELU and ReLU activation functions?\n",
        "Mainly, they handle negative values differently:\n",
        "* ReLU: Returns 0 for any negative input (f(x)=max(0,x)). This can lead to \"dying neurons\" where a neuron gets stuck at zero and never updates again\n",
        "* ELU: Uses an exponential curve (f(x)=α(ex−1)) for negative values, that smooths out to a constant. ELU allows for a mean activation closer to zero, which speeds up convergence.\n",
        "4. What cost function are we trying to minimize?\n",
        "The model is trying to minimize Categorical Crossentropy. This is the standard loss function for multi-class classification problems. It measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution (from the Softmax layer) and the actual one-hot encoded label of the amino acid.\n",
        "5. How many convolutional layers are used in this architecture?\n",
        "There are 3 convolutional layers in this function:\n",
        "* Conv3D with 1×1×1 kernel.\n",
        "* Conv3D with 3×3×3 kernel.\n",
        "* Conv3D with 4×4×4 kernel.\n",
        "6. On which layers dropout technique is used? I invite you to review this [page](https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html).\n",
        "Dropout is applied to the Feedforward (Dense) section of the network:\n",
        "* Immediately after the Flatten layer (Dropout rate: 0.4)\n",
        "* After the first hidden Dense layer (layer1, Dropout rate: 0.2)\n",
        "* After the second hidden Dense layer (layer2, Dropout rate: 0.1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Dropout randomly \"shuts off\" a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents the model from overfitting (relying too heavily on specific neurons) and forces it to learn more robust, generalized features about the protein structure."

It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR, sensitivity or recall) against the False Positive Rate (FPR or 1 - specificity) at various thresholds, providing a visual representation of the trade-off between correctly identifying positive cases and incorrectly classifying negative ones.
